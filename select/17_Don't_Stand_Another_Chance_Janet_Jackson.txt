Standing at the edge of time 'bout to lose my mind,
'Cause you tried to take him away from me.
I won't let it be.
You just walk into my life trying to take away my only prize.
But you better give credit 'cause his love is right here for me.

You don't stand another chance.
You don't stand another chance.
You don't stand another chance.
You don't stand another chance.

He belongs to me, just wait and see.
Take him in his arms and give him love,
Not too much of me.
Nothing you can do or say to make him look your way.
So you better give credit
'Cause it's gonna come walking my way.

You don't stand another chance.
You don't stand another chance.
(You don't stand it, baby.) You don't stand.
(You don't stand another chance.) You don't stand.
You don't stand another chance. (Oooh!)

Ah, ah, ah, ah.

(You don't stand another chance.) You don't stand.
You don't stand another chance.

Sit and wait at home 'bout to leave me alone.
(I know, baby.)
You'll be with him when he's up not down
To keep him on the ground.
Let me tell you something, it's true.
He's not in love with you.
So you better give credit
'Cause it's nothing coming down your way.

(You don't stand another chance.) Not a chance, baby.
You don't stand another chance.
(Stand it, baby.) You don't stand, baby.
You don't stand another chance. (Oooh!)
You don't stand, baby. (You don't stand another chance.)

You don't stand. (Oooh!)
(You don't stand) Well, you know somebody's gotta lose.
We all can't win.
(A chance.) Maybe next time, okay?
(Oooh!)
You guys are confusing. (Laughing)

(You don't stand another chance.) You don't stand.
You don't stand another chance.
(You don't stand it, baby.) You don't stand, baby.
(You don't stand another chance.) You don't stand
(You don't stand another chance.) Another chance.
(You don't stand another chance.) You don't stand.
You don't stand another chance.
(You don't stand it, baby.) You don't stand, baby.
You don't stand another chance.
