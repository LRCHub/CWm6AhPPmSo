I miss the way you kiss
And the way you look
I'm an open book, I know
Each time I think of you
I'm torn apart

My cryin' heart knows
Just a chain of circumstance
We never had a chance

Time flies, tomorrow cries
For yesterday
But we learn the truth today
And with or without you
I will feel the same
We're not to blame 'cause

We're just no good at true romance
Maybe, we'll get another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

I will wait for the day
Even though, you are nowhere insight
I don't care what they say
And God only knows, how I miss you tonight

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

I miss the way you kiss
Maybe, another chance
Each time I see you ah
Maybe, another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance

Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
Maybe, another chance
